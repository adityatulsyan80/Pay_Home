I have built a single-page website using react.js and tailwindcss which is an introduction page of PayPal.
It consists of 3 components navbar, middle_body, and the footer.
To start the website just pull the repository in your PC and type:- yarn start
This will start the website in your localhost. It is also deployed on Netlify.
You can have a look at the website through this link:- https://661734342396b00bad6c4987--intropaypal.netlify.app
